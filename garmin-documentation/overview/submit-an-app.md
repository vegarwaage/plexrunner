# Submit an App - Connect IQ Developer Guide

## Overview

This page outlines the process for publishing Connect IQ applications to the Connect IQ Store.

## Preparation Steps

Before submission, developers must:

1. **Update manifest**: Ensure the app manifest specifies all target products
2. **Export project**: Use the "Monkey C: Export Project" command in Visual Studio Code extension
3. **Generate IQ file**: Complete the export wizard to create a `.iq` file containing binaries for all supported products
4. **Select languages** (optional): Click "Next" in the wizard to update supported language list before finalizing
5. **Verify completion**: Confirm successful generation with no errors

## Publishing Process

### First Upload

Developers submit their `.iq` file to the Connect IQ Store. The system will:

- Validate the binary
- Allow preview and personal testing
- Keep the app hidden from the Store during review
- Notify the developer upon approval
- Display the approved app in the Connect IQ Store

### Approval Timeline

The review process evaluates submissions against established guidelines. Developers receive notification when their app is approved and becomes publicly available.

## Key Resources

**General Guidelines**: Developers should review the app review guidelines before submission to expedite approval.

**Important Note**: Guidelines may change at any time.
